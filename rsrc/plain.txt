YOU'VE GOT MAIL WORKS ALOT BETTER THAN IT DESERVES TO .
IN ORDER TO MAKE THE FILM A SUCCESS , ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS CAST TWO EXTREMELY POPULAR AND ATTRACTIVE STARS , HAVE THEM SHARE THE SCREEN FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS AND THEN COLLECT THE PROFITS .
NO REAL ACTING WAS INVOLVED AND THERE IS NOT AN ORIGINAL OR INVENTIVE BONE IN IT'S BODY ( IT'S BASICALLY A COMPLETE RE-SHOOT OF THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER , ONLY ADDING A FEW MODERN TWISTS ) .
ESSENTIALLY , IT GOES AGAINST AND DEFIES ALL CONCEPTS OF GOOD CONTEMPORARY FILMMAKING .
IT'S OVERLY SENTIMENTAL AND AT TIMES TERRIBLY MUSHY , NOT TO MENTION VERY MANIPULATIVE .
BUT OH , HOW ENJOYABLE THAT MANIPULATION     IS .
BUT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE CASTING AND MANIPULATION THAT MAKES THE MOVIE WORK AS WELL AS IT DOES , BECAUSE I ABSOLUTELY HATED THE PREVIOUS RYAN HANKS TEAMING , SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE .
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE DIRECTING , BECAUSE BOTH FILMS WERE HELMED BY THE SAME WOMAN .
I HAVEN'T QUITE YET FIGURED OUT WHAT I LIKED SO MUCH ABOUT YOU'VE GOT MAIL , BUT THEN AGAIN , IS THAT REALLY IMPORTANT ?
IF YOU LIKE SOMETHING SO MUCH , WHY EVEN QUESTION IT ?
AGAIN , THE STORYLINE IS AS CLICHED AS THEY COME .
TOM HANKS PLAYS JOE FOX , THE INSANELY LIKEABLE OWNER OF A DISCOUNT BOOK CHAIN AND MEG RYAN PLAYS KATHLEEN KELLEY , THE EVEN MORE INSANELY LIKEABLE PROPRIETOR   OF A FAMILY-RUN CHILDREN'S BOOK SHOP CALLED , IN A NICE HOMAGE , THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER .
FOX AND KELLEY SOON BECOME BITTER RIVALS BECAUSE THE NEW FOX BOOKS STORE IS OPENING UP RIGHT ACROSS THE BLOCK FROM THE SMALL BUSINESS .
LITTLE DO THEY KNOW , THEY ARE ALREADY IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER OVER THE INTERNET , ONLY NEITHER PARTY KNOWS THE OTHER PERSON'S TRUE IDENTITY .
THE REST OF THE STORY ISN'T IMPORTANT BECAUSE ALL IT DOES IS SERVE AS A MERE BACKDROP FOR THE TWO STARS TO SHARE THE SCREEN .
SURE ,     THERE ARE SOME MILDLY INTERESTING SUBPLOTS , BUT THEY ALL FAIL IN COMPARISON TO THE UTTER CUTENESS OF THE MAIN RELATIONSHIP .
ALL OF THIS , OF COURSE , LEADS UP TO   THE PREDICTABLE CLIMAX,
BUT AS FORESEEABLE AS THE ENDING IS , IT'S SO DAMN CUTE AND WELL-DONE THAT I DOUBT ANY MOVIE IN THE ENTIRE YEAR CONTAINS A SCENE THE EVOKES AS MUCH PURE JOY AS THIS PART DOES
WHEN RYAN DISCOVERS THE TRUE IDENTITY OF HER ONLINE LOVE , I WAS     FILLED WITH SUCH , FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD , HAPPINESS THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME ALL YEAR , I ACTUALLY LEFT THE THEATER SMILING .
